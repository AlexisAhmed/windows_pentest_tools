Try various exploits to get root


These scripts are designed for webmasters to check the security of their webservers.

g0tr00t.sh will download and attempt to execute 117 local exploits to get root.

g0tr00t-self-contained.sh will unpack the exploits either from within the script using base64 and tar or you can
include exploits.tar.gz in the same directory as the script.
