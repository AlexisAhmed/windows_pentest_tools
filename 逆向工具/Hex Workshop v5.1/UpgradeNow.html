      <p>Customers purchasing new Hex Workshop license(s) or upgrade license(s) 
        within 45 days a major release receive free upgrades. When new unlocking 
        keys are required, BreakPoint Software typically emails the new unlocking 
        key to the registrant's email address (given at time of purchase).</p>
      <p>Customers purchasing Hex Workshop are entitled to all minor upgrades 
        for the purchased or upgraded to version. For example, if a customer purchased 
        a license for Hex Workshop v5.0, they are entitled to all minor revisions 
        (e.g. v5.01, v5.1, v5.8). Typically, a customer's Hex Workshop v5 unlocking 
        key will continue to unlock later v5.x versions. When new unlocking keys 
        are required, BreakPoint Software typically emails the new key to the 
        registrant's email address (given at time of purchase). </p>
