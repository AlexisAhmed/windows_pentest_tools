-[ Description ]--------------------------------------------------------

Hex Workshop is a set of hexadecimal development tools for Windows XP
and Vista.  It combines advanced binary editing with the ease and
flexibility of a word processor. With Hex Workshop you can edit, insert,
delete, cut, copy, and paste hex, print high quality customizable hex
dumps, and export to RTF or HTML for publishing.  Additionally, you can
goto, find, replace, compare, and calculate checksums within a file.

An Integrated Structure Viewer allows you to view and edit data in the
most intuitive and convenient way. This feature helps turn the art of
hex editing into a simple straightforward task. Structures are defined
in a text file that closely resemble the C/C++ style struct definitions.

Hex Workshop supports drag and drop and is integrated with the Windows
operating system so you can quickly and easily hex edit from your most
frequently used workspaces. The Data Inspector is perfect for
interpreting, viewing, and editing decimal and binary values.
Arithmetic, logical, ASCII case, and bitwise operations can be used to
help manipulation your data in place.
