Hex Workshop v5.1 - June 2008
---------------------------------
  ENHANCEMENTS
  - The Hex Workshop user interface includes updated icons and toolbars
    along with a new offset column header to highlight the current
    caret and offset positions.
  - The Structure Viewer panel now simultaneously displays and allows
    the editing of interpreted values in both decimal and hexadecimal. 
    The bookmark, compare, checksum, and find panels were also updated
    to include both decimal and hexadecimal columns where possible.
  - The Structure Viewer file format now supports additional data 
    accessors and more support for conditional data formats.
    - sizeof() returns the size of a variable in bytes
    - ubyteAt(), ushortAt(), and ulongAt() returns the 8, 16, or 32
      bit value at the specified file offset or variable value.
    - switch() allows for conditional structures based on the contents
      of a variable.
  - F7 and Shift+F7 keyboard accelerators jump to the next/previous 
    Bookmark.
  - Users can now copy and paste binary data between multiple instances
    of Hex Workshop.

    bytes (instead of by 16 bit word) and enabled automatical column
    sizing.

    if unabled to open disks/drives using logic adapted for
    Vista UAC privilege escalation.

    - The editor display could fail to repaint/redraw properly after a

      This problem was introduced as a side effect of upgrading from 
      MSVC 6.0 to Microsoft .NET 2003.
    - Hex Workshop failed to run on Windows 95 with an error message
      claiming that it needed "oleacc.dll".  This problem was introduced

Hex Workshop v4.20 - January 2004
---------------------------------
  NEW FEATURES
    - The Structure Viewer now supports 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit bitfields.
      A bitfield as defined by the C language allows users to modify and
      manipulate data without manually counting, shifting, or masking
      bits.
    - Users can now specify the data type length when exporting data as
      C source or Java source.  8, 16, 32, and 64 bit data types and
      byte swapping are also supported.
    - Hex Workshop can now be used to export data in the Base64 and
      UUEncoding formats.  Copy-As support is also available.
    - Users can now modify the starting offset and view file offsets in
      terms of bytes (default), number of words (bytes/2), or dwords
      (bytes/4).  The offset display is controlled by right clicking on
      the address column of the hex display.
    - Bookmarks are now easier to use and more useful.  The result of
      selecting or double-clicking a bookmark is different:
      - Selecting bookmark: Scrolls the bookmark into view without
        changing the cursor position.
      - Double-clicking bookmark's address: Moves the cursor position to
        the bookmark's address.
      - Double-clicking length: Selects the bookmark data within the
        editor.
      - Double-clicking bookmark's description: Allows you to edit the
        description in place.
      - Double-clicking bookmark's value: If a data type was supplied,
        allows you to edit the data in place.
    - The Results Window has new "Output" tab to aid in development of
      structure definitions.  Debugging information and errors are
      displayed in the "Output" window whenever a user opens a new
      structure definition file.
    - The Structure Viewer's right-click popup menu now contains menu
      entries for "Copy" and "Edit".
    - The Export As dialog now contains a button to modify export

      preferences.
    - F2 may now be used to begin editing the selected structure viewer
      value.
    - Ctrl+C now copies values to the clipboard from the Data Inspector
      and Structure Viewer.

      Inspector's and Results Window's tab control.

      array elements.
    - "Junk entires" are no longer left after collapsing some structure
      definitions.

      unsigned modifiers.

Hex Workshop v4.10 - May 2003
-----------------------------

      array length definition.
    - Users can now define their own data types using the "typedef"

      Enumerated types allow users to create human readable identifiers
      for unique numeric values.  
    - Hex Workshop Structure Libraries can now reference other structure
      libraries by using a #include directive.  This feature offers
      users better control and organization of their structure files. 
    - End users can now calculate up to 12 different checksums within
      Hex Workshop.  The latest checksum algorithm allows users to
      define a 16 bit or 32 bit CRC by supplying the polynomial, initial
      value, reflective properties, and final XOR value.
    - When clicking the right mouse button over the offset portion of
      the hex editing display, a new context menu is displayed with
      various offset related options: 
      - Switch between hexadecimal and decimal addresses.
      - Specify a starting offset value.
      - Modify how Hex Workshop calculates offset addresses in the hex
        editing display.
      - Modify the length of digits displayed in document offsets.

      specify the fill byte used for unspecified data regions.

      order of bytes display in the editor.

  BUG FIXES
    - Prior to v4.10, imported Intel Hex Code documents could be
      corrupted when records overlapped.  This problem has been
      addressed. 
    - Prior to v4.10, if users clicked on a read-only portion of the
      structure viewer display instead of an editable element, editing
      was not initiated upon pressing F2.  Now, pressing F2 will invoke
      the in-placing edit feature for bookmarks, structures, and the
      data inspector whenever an element has active focus.
    - When an element in the structure viewer has active focus, pressing
      the left and right arrow keys will now collapse or expand the
      structure.
